# Faction Pyramid

An organizational chart application built with Vue.js, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 22.x or higher recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

To check if you have Node.js and npm installed, run:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

If you don't have them installed, download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). npm is included with Node.js.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd FactionPyramid
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages including Vue.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and other dependencies.

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is already in use). The dev server includes hot module replacement, so changes you make will be reflected immediately in the browser.
